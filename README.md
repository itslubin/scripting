# Scripting tools ✍🏻

## Inspiration 💭
Some daily tasks or project worflows were and still are pretty repetitive and they have drained a lot of time from me, that's why I have automated some of these type of tasks with some scripts written in Python.

## What it does 🖥
By translating routine actions into code, I can simply organise enormous amount of files in seconds or create, delete, copy and compile a lot of files just by hitting a few commands.

I've not only saved time and effort but also ensured consistent and accurate task execution. This strategic automation has allowed me to focus on more complex aspects of my work, optimizing efficiency and productivity while showcasing the potential of innovative solutions.
